<F1>		Closes this window.

(It's actually an |Insert-mode| mapping for |help| buffers.)

Global bindings:

						*i_<C-RETURN>*
<C-RETURN>	Executes command (SQL, DML, DDL etc.) in |paragraph|. 
						*i_<S-RETURN>*
<S-RETURN>	Describes table under the cursor.
						*i_<C-F9>*
<C-F9>		Equalizes all windows (|CTRL-W_=|).

						*i_<F8>*
<F8>		Toggles |'wrap'|: when on, lines longer than the width of the
		window will wrap and displaying continues on the next line.
						*i_<F9>*
<F9>		Opens the Result buffer if in a buffer other than it; toggle
                its size (tall or short) when in it.
						*i_<F10>*
<F10>		Closes the Result buffer.

						*i_<C-kMinus>*
<C-kMinus>	|resize| the window with -5 as parameter.
						*i_<C-kPlus>*
<C-kPlus>	|resize| the window with +5 as parameter.

						*i_<M-/>*
<M-/>		Toggles source code line comments. Works with selections too.

Bindings exclusive to SQL buffers (|sql.vim|):

Esc Esc		- Makes the current window the only one on the screen (|:only|).
F5		- Refreshes (|:e| re-edit) the current file.

Easy mode also sources |$VIMRUNTIME|/mswin.vim, which, among others, provides
the following binding:

CTRL-S		Saves the file.

What follows are default mappings for easy mode.

From |starting.txt|:

EVim runs Vim as click-and-type editor.  This is very unlike the original Vi
idea.  But it helps for people that don't use Vim often enough to learn the
commands.  Hopefully they will find out that learning to use Normal mode
commands will make their editing much more effective.
